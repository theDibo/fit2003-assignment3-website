								<h2>Cryptographic techniques of strategic data splitting and secure information management (2015)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Douglas Rintoul</span>
							</header>
							<p>This paper was published in the scientific journal Pervasive and Mobile Computing. It was written by Lidia Ogiela from AGH University of Science and Technology. The paper was originally written in September 2014, revised in March 2015 and was first available online on the 19th of May, 2015. It presents various techniques of classifying (hiding) strategic information - mainly important financial figures which can compromise the security of an organisation.</p>
							<p>The paper covers various data splitting and sharing protocols, including an interesting method of storing information between multiple parties. It describes a method in which data is split between n parties, and in order to properly reconstruct the information all n parties must combine their data. It also discusses several algorithms that can be used, including one called the Asmuth-Bloom algorithm - if you are interested in this subject, I recommend that you look up more information about this algorithm.</p>

								<h2>Analysis of personal information security behaviour and awareness (2015)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Caitlyn Zhou</span>
							</header>
							<p>This article was written by Gizem Ög ̆ ütçü, Özlem Müge Testik and Oumout Chouseinoglou from the faculty of commercial science at Bas ̧kent University and department of industrial Engineering at Hacettepe Univeristy in Ankara, Turkey. This article was sent to ScienceDirect on 29 June 2015 and published on their website on 3 November 2015. The main point of this article is analysing the information security behaviour, scales that are used for the study of the information security behaviour and also the results and explanation of the results from the study.</p>
							<p>This article introduced two main research studies: to identify the relationship between individuals’ behaviours of using technologies and their risk awareness to information security, and to study people’s information security perception and their behaviour of using technologies. From the article’s point of view that in any organisations, the biggest threat of information security is always the individuals working in the companies because of the uncertainty and the different possibilities of people’s behaviours. The study has showed that the society needs to be more aware of the risks in information security and the more people aware of the risks, the more protective they behave. However, people do not usually report cyber crimes since they do not know where and who to contact. Interestingly, people often find it more personal to share their contact information rather than personal information. Moreover, people that had higher education usually are more aware of their information security.</p>

								<h2>Internet of Things: Convenience vs. privacy and secrecy (2015)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Finn Hartshorn</span>
							</header>
							<p>Published December 2015 in volume 58, Issue 6 of Business Horizons pages 616-624. Written by Bruce D. Weinberga, George R. Milnea, Yana G. Andonovab, Fatima M. Hajjata. This article explores the Internet of Things (IoT) and how it will affect privacy and security. The articles begins by trying to provide a succinct definition of IoT before exploring the benefits it can offer. Finally the article talks about the risks associated with IoT, specifically security and privacy before touching on what can be done to minimize these risks.
</p>
							<p>IoT devices “allow the physical and natural world to be integrated and become accessible via the internet”. One of the core ideas is the collection and sharing of data between other devices, however there are some significant drawbacks to this  mass interconnectivity of IoT devices, namely privacy and security. IoT devices allow even more sensitive data to be collected without consumers actively interacting with the web.</p>
							<p>The risks posed by hacking or misuse of personal information are already significant, the proliferation of IoT devices and an increased presence in our lives will only heighten this risk. In a heavily IoT involved world, personal privacy starts to be eroded in favour of convenience, with many consumers forced to trust that companies with access to their data will do the right thing.

								<h2>Communications Data Retention in an evolving internet (2010)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Tim Scott</span>
							</header>
							<p>This article was written by Ian Brown, from the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), and published on July 5 2010 in the International Journal of law and information technology. Even though it deals with legal cases that have already been resolved the issues presented in this article are still relevant today and there are things we can learn from Ian’s Analysis of these Events.</p>
							<p>This article is about how the recent developments in online communication technology has changed the way people talk and that with these changes comes a set of new problems and issues. Security Services and other interested entities are storing data for long periods of time and some countries has mandated that certain data be kept. In the EU there have been several Courts that have taken issue to this and have stopped the retention of data by governmental organisations and offered suggestions how the Data retention laws might be changed to better suit the new online environment. These courts are supported by the fact that almost all data is used within the first 6 months and there is very little evidence for a decrease in crimes if data is retained as opposed to it not being retained. As such their suggestion is that Data be kept for a maximum of six months, except under special circumstances, and it be controlled and stored by a verity of entities to ensure that no one group has complete control over the data and so decrease the possibility of exploiting it.</p>
