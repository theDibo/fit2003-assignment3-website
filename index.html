								<h2>What is "Personal Information"?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Personal information is defined as <em>"information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable"</em> in the Australian Privacy Act of 1988. That's a lot of words to essentially say that if someone knows who you are, or they can find out who you are from the information, then any data they have is considered personal. The obvious examples of personal information are names, birthdays, credit card information, licence numbers and other things similar to that. However, personal information also includes informaiton like what things you buy online, what sites you visit and how often - including browsing history you <strong>think</strong> is private. Personal information about us is everywhere, and you should always be wary of who has what information about you.</p>

								<h2>Where is it stored and who has it?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Personal information is stored almost everywhere - on your local machine, on huge databases, on removable storage mediums, and online. The recent rise of cloud storage means that some of your personal information is almost undoubtedly being stored somewhere that is accessible through the internet - whether you know it or not. We don't always recognise that informaiton we are viewing is of a personal nature, and it's also very common for others to upload your personal information (whether they realise it or not).</p>

								<h2>Recent Events</h2>
							</header>
							<p>There have been countless events in the past that have reinforced the need to be very wary of storing personal information online, and being aware of where it is and how it is secured. These include the Sony Playstation hack of 2011, where thousands of credit card details were compromised and many people's personal information was leaked. Another significant recent event is the Ashley Madison hack of 2015. This was a life-ruining event for many people who, because of the identifying nature of the information compromised, were completely exposed for their online activity. This is often thought of as something that only happens to others - but be aware. It <strong>can</strong> happen to you, and you need to be prepared for it.</p>
