								<h2>Cloud Storage Security: A Practical Guide (2015)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Douglas Rintoul</span>
							</header>
							<p>This book was written by Aaron Wheeler and Michael Winburn, and published by Elsevier B.V in 2015. The book covers the topic of cloud storage, and the various security challenges and risks that come with storing data in the cloud. In particular, the book focuses on personal information, and the various ways that storing this in the cloud can be risky.</p>
							<p>Throughout the book’s chapters, the topic of data storage is covered from different angles. First, the basic details of cloud storage and some popular options are discussed. These options are analysed for their privacy policies, examining exactly how secure each option is and whether or not they allow any third party access to or scanning of your data. Chapters 3 and 4 take a more legal approach, examining the various government standards and regulations that cloud data storage providers must/can adhere to. Finally, the source examines the future of cloud data storage, and what challenges any future advancements may bring. I highly recommend this source to anyone who is interested in learning more about cloud data storage and how it is controlled.</p>

								<h2>Security Planning, An Applied Approach (2015)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Caitlyn Zhou</span>
							</header>
							<p>The book was written by Susan Lincke from University of Wisconsin-Parkside, Kenosha, WI, USA, published by Springer in 2015. This book introduced security threats, the examples of them and also the steps of developing a medium level security plan.</p>
							<p>As there are too many ways of cyber fraud, for example, wireless network theft, skimmer scams and social engineering, the frauds are very smart and they always come up with new tricks, so what we need to do is to improve our awareness of all the suspicious contacts, and report any fraud we know to stop them from attacking more people. There are strategic security plans and tactical security plans introduced in this book. Strategic security planning is mainly about knowing about the potential risks and how to manage them; the impact of the business and how to improve the security of the business for disk backup and recovery, cloud service and high-availability solutions. Tactical security planning is how we actually carry out the security plan. The author mentioned how to design for information security, selecting technology and implementation options, how the hackers attack, designing physical security and how to protect personal information.</p>

								<h2>Security and the Networked Society (2013)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Finn Hartshorn</span>
							</header>
							<p>Published 2013 by Springer. Authors: Mark Gregory & David Glance. This book attempts to analyse the effect of recent (2012-2013) technological advances and events and how they’ve affected society, both in terms of how society functions as well as how it has changed how society views technology as a result of these advances and events. The book consists of a large collection of articles grouped by categories such as Hacking, Cybercrime, Internet, Smartphones and applications. In particular, the book talks about how the increased use of technology and its interconnectedness affects the security and privacy of the general populace.</p>
							<p>The book begins by talking about Hacking with a particular focus on the Anonymous and LulzSec groups. The seconds section concerns Cybercrime and cyber security, a similar topic to Hacking, however in this section the book focuses more on the consequences of breaches. The following sections, ‘Internet’, ‘Smart Phones’ and ‘Applications’ are all much more general than the initial two, however countless articles in these sections refer back to the topics of cybersecurity and privacy tying them into the book's overarching theme of security and privacy.</p>

								<h2>Data mining in public and private Sectors organizational and governmental applications (2010)</h2>
								<span class="byline">Gathered by Tim Scott</span>
							</header>
							<p>This book was written by Annti Sycajarvi and Jari Stenvall in 2010. It explores the uses of data mining and the ethical and legal dilemmas of Data Mining. Both Authors are Professors at Finnish University’s and although this is their only published book both have other papers to their names. The book is divided into four separate sections, each dealing with a particular aspect of the topic, the first deals with data mining in relation to government and management. The second, which is the one we are interested in, deals with privacy, security and the retention. The third relates to organizations that use Data mining as a forecasting tool and the final Section deals with various data mining applications and approaches.</p>
							<p>As this book is largely an informative piece the authors do their best not to present any opinion other than technical, on the issues being discussed. Presenting points from many different views without bias. They summarise by saying that almost every aspect of the field is evolving at an almost unbelievable rate, but the issues behind it stay the same. So there should be a discussion now so that the growth can be prevented from going in unethical directions.</p>
